# esp32-4848
I bought this panel from ali - https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806149272881.html

It comes with a kind of demo program that allows you to connect to your wifi and controls the 3 relays (I assume 1 relay if you get that version). You couldn't configure the screen in anyway. I flashed it with a yaml file I found online and the screen went blank. I spent a lot of hours trying to get this to work at all and this project is my best attempts. Feel free to use it to get you started.

yaml file for home assistant to make the esp32-4848S040C panel functional
